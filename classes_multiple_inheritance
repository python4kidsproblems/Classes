# Make a Person Class, a Coder Class and a Student Class. Make the       #
# Student Class inherit from both the Person and the Coder CLasses.      #
# The Person Class should have name, age and gender attributes.          #
# The Coder Class should have a list of languages,                       #
# e.g ["Python", "Java"]                                                 #
# The student should inherit name and age attributes from Person Class   #
# and language attributes from Coder CLass. It should also have it's     #
# own attribute called Grade, an Int containing which class they are in. #
# It should also have a list of Techers, and another list of Subjects.   #
# Make getter and setter methods for all three Classes.                  #
# Add a method that checks whether a Student knows a particular          #
# language.                                                              #
# Add a method that checks whether the Students Grade is above 6 or not. #
# Add a method that checks whether the Student is taught by a particular #
# teacher.                                                               #
# Add a method that checks whether a Student is studying a particular    #
# subject.                                                               #

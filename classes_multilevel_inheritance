# Make a Polygon Class, a Quadrilateral Class, a Rhombus Class and a     #
# Square.The Quadrilateral should inherit from the Polygon Class, The    #
# Rhombus should inherit from the Quadrilateral, the Square should       #
# inherit from the Rhombus, like so:                                     #
# Polygon -> Quadrilateral -> Rhombus -> Square                          #
# The Polygon Class should have attributes color and number of sides.    #
# Quadrilateral Class should have default value of 4 for numer of sides  #
# and take the size of all four sides from user. It should also take 4   #
# angles from the user.                                                  #
# A Rhombus should take size of one side from user and set all sides of  #
# quadrilateral equal to that one side. It should also take one angle    #
# from the user and set the four angles accordingly.                     #
# A square should only take one size for the side and set the angles to  #
# 90 by default.                                                         #

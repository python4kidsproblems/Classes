# You are asked to make a login system for an application. You need to   #
# have a Login class, this class holds details of the User name and the  #
# password. Add a getter for user name but not for password.             #
# The User Name and password should only be able to be set by            #
# instantiation.                                                         #
# Add a method that asks the user to enter password and checks if the    #
# password entered is correct. If it is wrong then print:                #
# "Access Denied!", if it is correct then say hello to User using their  #
# User name.                                                             #

# You are asked to design an online shopping cart. A shopping cart can   #
# have many items.                                                       #
# Firstly, you’ll implement the class Item. Item has a unique Id, a      #
# quantity number and a name. You may assign the id and price randomly.  #
# Take name input from user regarding the item they want to purchase.    #
# Once a user buys an item it’s added to their shopping cart. Therefore, #
# your class shopping cart has an items array in which all items are     #
# being added.                                                           #
# The user may want to reduce the number of any items from the cart, in  #
# such a case your cart should have the functionality to decrease the    #
# quantity of item by one by taking the item name as input from user.    #
# Before Checkout you have to ask the user whether they want to remove   #
# any item from cart, If the user decides to remove any item/items       #
# remove it that item should be removed from your array of items in      #
# Shopping Cart by taking item name as input.                            #
#                                                                        #

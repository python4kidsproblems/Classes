# Make a class with the dictionary you made earlier of names and ages of #
# people. You may copy the code you wrote earlier but the code should be #
# implemented in the constructor. Your class should take the name of the #
# file, names_ages.txt, and then store them in a dictionary attribute of #
# your class, this will all be code you wrote before.                    #
# Your class should have methods (functions) that implement the          #
# following:                                                             #
#   a. print all the names arranged alphadetically                       #
#   b. return the range of the ages                                      #
#   c. print the names and ages arranges age wise (olderst to youngest)  #
#   d. take name and age as parameters and add the two to the dictionary #
#      of names and ages.                                                #
#   e. take name and age as parameters and delete the two from the       #
#      dictionary of names and ages.                                     #
#   f. takes a name as parameter and return a bool to tell whether that  #
#      person is in the dictionary.                                      #
